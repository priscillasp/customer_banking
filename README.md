# Savings and CD Account Interest Calculator
## Features
- Savings Account Calculator: Users can calculate the interest earned on their savings account. 
- CD Account Calculator:  Users can calculate the interest earned on their cd account. 
- Interactive User Input: The program prompts users for their account details and performs calculations based on real-time inputs.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. 

2. Download the project files and clone the repository to your local computer:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/priscillasp/customer_banking.git
    ```
3. Navigate into the project directory: 
    ```bash
    cd customer_banking
    ```

## Usage
To run the program, enter the following to your command line
```bash
python customer_banking.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your savings and CD account details. The program will then display the interest earned over the specified period and the updated account balance.

## Functionality 
The project consists of two main functions:
- Create_savings_account: Calculates interest for a savings account.
- create_cd_account: Calculates interest for a CD account.
- Both functions take the account balance, interest rate, and maturity length as arguments to calculate and return the interest earned and the updated balance.
